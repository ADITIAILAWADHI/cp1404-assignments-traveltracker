# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Travel Tracker
Assignment 2 for CP1404/CP1804, IT@JCU

By: **Aditi Ailawadhi**

This repo contains assignment 1 files including a Python file, two CSV files and assignment 2 files including 6
python files and 1 Kivy application file.  
(`temp.csv` is to copy from in case you delete the contents of `places.csv` and want the original data back).

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?
> It took me a week with a couple of hours each day.

Coding and development process:
> Classes made it easier to develop the GUI program as it saved a lot of extra effort and work saving repetition of
> codes. I am satisfied with this assignment is on how to make work with multiple classes and
> also make a Kivy application. I found coding the GUI program hard at the starting, but the lecture notes on Kivy
> and CP1404 Kivy Demos repository made my coding process much easier. The easiest part I found in this assignment was
> to change assignment 1 functions to the Class methods for the assignment 2. I found the concept of unit, integration
> and system testing quite helpful in testing working of my Place and Placecollection classes in every step of my
> coding process to look for any errors, if any in my code to improve my code to make my app run smoothly. Working with
> classes was very interesting. Same classes and methods were used in both console and GUI programs which saved
> repetition of codes. Overall, I am satisfied with this assignment, though it was lengthy but now I feel
> confident working with python after completing this assignment which covered almost every part of python from basic
> to advanced level from simple functions to using multiple classes with methods and developing an application on Kivy.
